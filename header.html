        <section><article><h2>Russia and Ukraine war</h2>
        <p>Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Saturday it had foiled a plot by Ukrainian intelligence services to kill
        a high-ranking Russian officer and a war blogger, the Interfax news agency reported.
        Ukrainian forces have killed or wounded more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers Russia has sent to fight them, according
        to Ukraine and South Korea. “Their losses are significant, very significant. We see that neither the Russian military
        nor their North Korean overseers have any interest in ensuring the survival of these North Koreans,” Ukrainian President
        Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Friday. United States National Security Council spokesperson John
        Kirby, meanwhile, said a “human wave” of North Korean troops was being sent to their deaths in “hopeless” attacks by
        generals who saw them as expendable.</p>

        <aside>Russia’s Ministry of Defence said on Friday that its forces had taken control of two eastern Ukrainian villages,
        Ivanivka in the Donetsk region and Zahryzove in the Kharkiv region, the RIA state news agency reported.
        RIA also cited the ministry as claiming it had downed four British-made Storm Shadow missiles in the past week.
        A North Korean soldier, who was fighting for Russia, has died in Ukrainian captivity due to severe wounds, according to
        South Korea’s spy agency.
        Ukrainian air defence shot down 13 out of 24 Russian drones launched in an overnight attack, the air force said on
        Friday. The air force said the other 11 Russian drones were “lost” without causing damage.</aside>
